# Face-Recognition-using-Python

This program takes two images as input one as known faces image and sencond as unknown face.(We use face encoding to compare two faces)
It then finds the face encodings of all the faces in known image and the unknown image and compares it to store the final output in an array.
(Face Encoding maps human faces into 128D vectors where pictures of the same person are mapped near to each other and pictures of different people are mapped far apart.)
In array if the value is True it means that match is found otherwise not.
